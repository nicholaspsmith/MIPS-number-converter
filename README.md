MIPS-number-converter
=====================

Convert a number to base 1-10, using specified number of digits.
----------------------------------------------------

* Run the included jar (MARS.jar)
* Open up prog3.s
* Compile
* Run
* Enter number, base that you want to print number in (e.g. '2' for binary), and number of digits of accuracy desired.

I do not own MARS program. It is simply included for convenience.  It can be found on the Missouri State University site here: http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm
