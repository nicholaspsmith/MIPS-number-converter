MIPS-number-converter
=====================

Convert a number to base 1-10, using specified number of digits.

Run using the included jar (MARS.jar)

* I do not own MARS program.  It can be found on the Missouri State University site here: http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm

It is simply included for convenience.
